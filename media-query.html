            <section><h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
                <p>
                    And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the 
                    things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no 
                    commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them 
                    that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.
                </p>

            <section><h2>Mosiah 2:41</h2>
                <p>
                    And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy 
                    state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed 
                    in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful 
                    to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God 
                    in a state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things 
                    are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.
